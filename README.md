# Galerkin-based-Granger-Causality
This repository provides MATLAB implementations of **Galerkin-based Granger Causality (GGC)**, a modified Granger causality framework tailored to the mathematical structure of Galerkin-type reduced-order models (ROMs). GGC enables quantitative causal analysis among modal coefficients in complex fluid flows.
